stax (dMVC)
===========

Distributed Model / View / Controller (framework)
-------------------------------------------------

### Imaginable!

* What if your application storage layer could be distributed across a farm of database servers.
* What if you had the ability to **Hot Swap** an entire database server from that farm.
* What if you could do all this with **Your** database of choice.


### Realizabile?

I think so. Starting at the bottom: [The Model](https://github.com/nomilous/shox)
